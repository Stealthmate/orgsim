Yet again I spend like 3h working on this.

I managed to get a basic game running. I even implemented metrics and scoring. Yay, I guess?

I'm still pretty confused as to what I actually want to do with this, but I came to the realization that I'm essentially bumping into a "character design" problem. It kinda feels like I made the game engine for World of Warcraft, but now I have no idea what classes to add to the game. I suppose this is more of a creative rather than technical limitation.

I have a friend who's into board games and stuff like that (actually, I have more than one such friends), so I'll try talking to them about this as well. Maybe they can give me some nice ideas?

In the meantime, I should probably take a small break from this. I've been spending way too much time banging my head against the wall and I'll probably end up burning out at this rate. Maybe if I play some Skyrim for a while, I might get some fresh ideas on what Org/Individuals to implement.
