    "\n",
    "I added a simple ABC definition for `Metrics` inside `world`, and wrote the logic for logging the most fundamental values for each model. Currently those are mostly related to the number of individuals in the world - number of people alive, number of people killed and number of people recruited. Though I should be able to add more metrics pretty easily, if I ever need to.\n",

    "- Individuals' `init` method was not being called on recruitment, so I fixed that.\n",
    "- Individuals should be able to do cleanup on death, so I added a `die` method to hold that logic.\n",
    "- `BaseWorldState` holds the seeding logic as a classmethod now."
