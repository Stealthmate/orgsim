    "I added a simple ABC definition for `Metrics` inside `world`, and wrote the logic for logging the most fundamental values for each model. Currently those are mostly related to the number of individuals in the world - number of people alive, number of people killed and number of people recruited. Though I should be able to add more metrics pretty easily, if I ever need to.\n",
